 "description": "The Los Angeles Chargers are a professional American football team based in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The Chargers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The club began play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), and spent its first season in Los Angeles, before moving to San Diego in 1961 to become the San Diego Chargers.[4] The Chargers joined the NFL as result of the AFLï¿½NFL merger in 1970, and played their home games at Qualcomm Stadium. Between 1995 and 2016, the Chargers were the only NFL team based in Southern California after the Raiders and Rams moved out of Los Angeles at the end of the 1994 NFL season. A return of the Chargers to Los Angeles was announced for the 2017 season, just one year after the Rams had moved back themselves.[5][6][7] The Chargers will play their home games at the StubHub Center until the opening in 2019 of the Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park, which they will share with the Rams.",
